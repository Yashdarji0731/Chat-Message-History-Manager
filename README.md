This Python project implements a simple chat history manager with undo/redo functionality. It uses a queue (FIFO) to hold incoming messages and two stacks (LIFO) to manage undo and redo operations. Each message is stored along with a timestamp of when it was sent. The program provides a text-based menu so the user can send messages, view the chat history, undo the last message, redo an undone message, or exit. The design is modular and well-commented, suitable for a GitHub repository and easy for beginners to follow.

Features & How to Run: This program uses Pythonâ€™s standard libraries (collections.deque, datetime) and requires no special setup. To run it, save the code to a .py file (for example, chat_manager.py) and execute it with Python 3 (python chat_manager.py). Follow the on-screen menu to send messages, undo/redo, view history, or exit.
